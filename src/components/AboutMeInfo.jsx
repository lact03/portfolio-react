      <h4>
        I'm Luis Tabug, a passionate full-stack Web developer who embarked on
        this exhilarating journey into the world of coding to unravel the
        intricacies of technology and solve complex problems. My story in the
        realm of programming began when I eagerly joined the KodeGo bootcamp in
        May 2023. Over the course of three intense months, I immersed myself in
        the foundations of web development, delving into HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript during the initial two months. During this period, I honed my
        skills by creating a variety of projects, from a mini-project showcasing
        these technologies to more intricate applications like a quote generator
        and a quiz app.
        <br />
        <br />
        The final month of the bootcamp was a deep dive into advanced
        technologies, focusing on ReactJS, PHP, and Laravel. It was a
        challenging yet rewarding experience as we worked on projects that
        spanned the full stack, culminating in the development of a
        comprehensive full-stack application. Graduating from KodeGo's WD68
        batch on July 25, 2023, marked a pivotal moment in my journey, providing
        me with a solid foundation in web development.
        <br />
        <br />
        Post-graduation, my hunger for knowledge and commitment to excellence
        led me to explore backend technologies. I delved into MongoDB, Node.js,
        and Express.js, enhancing my skills to create robust and scalable
        server-side applications. As November unfolds, I find myself dedicated
        to deepening my understanding of programming. Currently, I'm engrossed
        in the realms of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures
        and Algorithms (DSA) with Java, aiming to fortify my problem-solving
        abilities and elevate my coding craftsmanship.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite having a diverse range of tech stacks under my belt, I am
        committed to continuous practice to ensure that my proficiency remains
        sharp and adaptable. My journey is an ongoing odyssey of learning and
        exploration, fueled by a fervent desire to push the boundaries of my
        expertise and contribute meaningfully to the dynamic world of web
        development. With dedication, determination, and a perpetual love for
        learning, I am confident in my ability to conquer any coding challenge
        that comes my way. Let's build the future, one line of code at a time.
